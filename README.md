# LBT-tax-calculator
Project to calculate LBT tax for buying property in Scotland

## Project for team coding as part of BJSS academy interview
The details for LBTT are not provided as part of the project, it is required to do my research. I will use: [Residential property rates and bands](https://revenue.scot/taxes/land-buildings-transaction-tax/residential-property)

The calculator is limited to the following buyer:

 - The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence 
 - The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e. it is purely for personal use 
 - The buyer does not own any other properties 
 - At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e. they intent to sell their current home at the same date they buy the new one 

My aim will be to get the same results as this page: [Property Transactions Calculator](https://revenue.scot/calculate-tax/calculate-property-transactions)
